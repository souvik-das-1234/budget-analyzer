5.  **Verification & Closure:** Once verified, the defect is marked as closed.
Regular reports on defect trends and resolution times will be generated to monitor quality.

### 8. 🚢 Deployment and Rollout
*Plan for releasing the project to users.*

**Deployment Plan:**
The deployment process will leverage CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent, automated, and reliable releases.

1.  **Staging Environment Deployment:**
    *   Once UAT is successfully completed and all critical bugs are resolved, the application will be deployed to a dedicated staging environment, mirroring production as closely as possible.
    *   Final sanity checks and smoke tests will be performed by the QA and DevOps teams.
2.  **Production Rollout - Phased Approach:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Pilot Launch):** The application will initially be rolled out to a small group of pilot users (e.g., 5-10 key marketing analysts and a finance representative). This allows for real-world usage feedback and identification of any unforeseen issues in a controlled environment.
    *   **Phase 2 (Wider Release):** Based on successful pilot feedback and resolution of any issues, the application will be incrementally rolled out to the broader Digital Marketing and Finance teams.
    *   **Deployment Strategy:** Blue/Green deployment will be preferred to minimize downtime. A new "green" environment will be deployed with the updated application, and traffic will be shifted gradually from the "blue" (old) environment to the "green" environment.
    *   **Automated Checks:** Automated health checks and performance monitoring will be active during traffic shifting to detect issues immediately.

**Rollback Procedures:**
Robust rollback procedures are critical to mitigate risks associated with new deployments.

1.  **Pre-Deployment Snapshot/Backup:** Before any production deployment, a full backup of the database and application configuration will be taken.
2.  **Automated Rollback Trigger:** Monitoring systems (e.g., CloudWatch alarms) will be configured to automatically trigger a rollback if critical errors (e.g., high error rates, service unavailability) are detected within a defined post-deployment window (e.g., 15-30 minutes).
3.  **Manual Rollback Process:** In case of non-automated critical failures or severe performance degradation, a manual rollback procedure will be initiated. This involves:
    *   Immediately shifting traffic back to the previous stable "blue" environment (in a Blue/Green setup).
    *   Reverting database changes if necessary (requires careful planning for backward compatibility).
    *   Alerting the development and operations teams for immediate investigation and root cause analysis.
4.  **Communication:** A clear communication plan will be in place to notify stakeholders in case of a rollback and provide status updates.
